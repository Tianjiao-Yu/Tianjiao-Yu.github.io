I am currently pursuing my **Ph.D. in Computer Science** at **Virginia Tech**, working with both [Dr.Ismini Lourentzou](https://isminoula.github.io/) and [Dr.Kurt Luther](https://crowd.cs.vt.edu/kurt-luther/). Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at Georgetown University and obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities.

Broadly I am interested in the area of Natural Language Processing. My research goal is to build models and machines that repond and **understand** natural languages in a manner similar to human. During my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to work on various interdisciplinary projects that combine linguistics, crowdsourced intelligence, and social analysis.

I have a fairly good understanding of theoretical syntax, and a broad expereince with programming language and frameworks, especially in Python and C++. Additionally, I have expeirence building AI-infused tools that augment human-computer collaborations. A combination of these skills makes me a strong candidate for research and development jobs that emphsize both prototype development and exploration of research frontiers.
