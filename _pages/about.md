I am currently a **Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science** at the **UIUC**, advised by [Dr. Ismini Lourentzou](https://isminoula.github.io/). I began my doctoral studies at Virginia Tech, where I had also worked under [Dr. Kurt Luther](https://crowd.cs.vt.edu/kurt-luther/). Prior to my Ph.D., I earned an M.S. in Computer Science from **Georgetown University** and a B.S. in Computer Science from the **University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.**

My research lies at the intersection of **natural language processing, multimodal learning**, and **embodied AI**. I am particularly interested in building language-enabled agents that can reason, act, and communicate within dynamic, interactive environments. My work explores how language understanding can be grounded in perception and action, enabling machines to navigate and adapt to the complexities of the real world. During my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to work on various interdisciplinary projects that combine **theoretical linguistics**, **crowdsourced intelligence**, and **social analysis**.
