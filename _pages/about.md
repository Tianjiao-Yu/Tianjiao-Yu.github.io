I am currently pursuing my **Ph.D. in Computer Science** at **UIUC**, working with [Dr. Ismini Lourentzou](https://isminoula.github.io/). I was initially a Phd student from Virginia Tech where I was also working under [Dr. Kurt Luther](https://crowd.cs.vt.edu/kurt-luther/). Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at Georgetown University and obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities.

Broadly I am interested in the area of Natural Language Processing. My research goal is to build models and machines that respond and **understand** natural languages in a manner similar to humans. During my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to work on various interdisciplinary projects that combine linguistics, crowdsourced intelligence, and social analysis.
