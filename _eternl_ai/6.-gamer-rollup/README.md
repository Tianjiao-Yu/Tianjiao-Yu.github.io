# 6. Gamer Rollup

Our Gamer Rollup ("Rollup") is the foundational layer that hosts our entire ecosystem and provides value in the following aspects:&#x20;

1. **Game Experience:** enable a player to use his AI assets and social network across all games. The vision is to shift from a game-centric experience to an ecosystem-centric experience, where every game in our Game Hub is an environment for the player to use his AI assets and flourish his social network. To enable the above, the key components are:&#x20;
   * **AI Agent NFT** act as cross-game AI "souls" of identity, personality and ability rights—access to special RAGs and model weights that enable special abilities such as AI assistant. Players can bring their AI agents across games in the platform. In-game assets by default are not cross-chain to avoid destabilization of game economies. &#x20;
   * **Social Graph**, which stores player and potentially AI agent relationships.      &#x20;
2. **Developer Monetization:** empower web2 game developers to monetize from unconventional channels on top of game deposits, such as via:&#x20;
   * **Global Players:** enabled by the global payment infrastructure of blockchain&#x20;
   * **Web3 Community:** launch tokens and NFTs for high-value crypto-native players.&#x20;
   * **AI Assets:** Developers can sell AI assets and agent abilities, such as dialogue styles, worldviews, and special game abilities such as AI-powered skills. In the future, AI assets can as well be catered to other developers, such as self-developed combat models or worldviews.  &#x20;
3. **Compute Network:** hosts compute transaction records and settles inferencing payments.  &#x20;
