# 7. AI-Native Game Concepts

The first in-house AI-native game, designed based on our Gaming AGI and produced by a leading game producer in the industry, aims to break through the boundaries of current game design.

## Game Genre

Our in-house game belongs to the brand new AI-Native RPG genre, including elements of MMORPG, Dungeons & Dragons ("DnD"), Adventure, True Away-From-Keyboard ("True AFK") experience, and more. This innovative genre enables players to bypass tedious and repetitive tasks found in traditional MMORPGs while maintaining full immersion and witnessing their character's growth. It amplifies the sense of exploration and interactivity seen in adventure games and D\&D, while granting players unparalleled freedom in decision-making.

## Game Story Background

In a realm consumed by ceaseless conflict, where gods, demons, titans, and humans clash in unending battles, safety is but a distant memory. Here, beings have honed innate defenses to brave perils even in slumber. Subconscious guardians emerge to safeguard their bodies, partake in social bonds, and embark on epic quests. Amidst this chaos, a fabled prophecy echoes through the ages—a "divine spirit" foretold to descend, illuminating and shaping destinies. This phenomenon, known as the "divine spark," flickers unpredictably, its duration a mystery, its purpose inscrutable. Whispers now speak of these subconscious protectors as denizens of another dimension, yet the truth remains shrouded, waiting to be unveiled.

## Game Highlights

Our Gaming AGI has revolutionized game design, introducing groundbreaking experiences:

1. **True AFK Experience:** Even when offline, AI seamlessly guides players' characters through social interactions, trading, adventuring, and combat. Players can log in at any time to observe and resume control, bypassing repetitive actions while maintaining immersion and witnessing character growth.
2. **Exclusive Adventures**: Each character possesses unique personality traits, shaping their every action, word, and adventure. This individuality ensures a one-of-a-kind experience, with adventures and outcomes tailored exclusively to each player.
3. **Naturally Evolving World**: Your every action and decision resonates throughout the universe, subtly altering its course. Beyond mere exploration, you become a catalyst for change in a living, breathing world shaped by the collective efforts of the community.
4. **Content Beyond Numbers**: Progress is measured not just by numerical stats, but by deeply personal narratives. Each increase in power, skill learned, or weapon obtained symbolizes significant milestones in a player's personal journey.

## Game Snapshots

Step into the realm of boundless imagination with our cutting-edge AGI tools, seamlessly integrated to create game experiences beyond one's wildest dreams. Behold the snapshots of unparalleled adventures enabled by AI:

* **The Mirror**: A gateway to enchantment, The Mirror invites players into a world of magic and mystery. Engage in captivating dialogue as players pose questions to The Mirror, which responds with its own inquiries, weaving a tapestry of lore unique to the player's character. Available even before the official game release, The Mirror offers a personalized prelude to player's epic journey.
* **The First Consciousness**: In this fantastical realm, every character possesses a primary consciousness capable of autonomous action. When players are absent, AI gracefully steps in, shaping objectives, executing actions, and shaping outcomes in their stead.
* **The Secondary Consciousness**: Legend whispers of a mystical subconscious native to the realm, known as "humans" and believed to hail from another dimension. When players connect, this Secondary Consciousness assumes control over the characters, guiding their destinies.
* **Consciousness Connection**: Witness the profound bond between the First and Second Consciousnesses as they gradually synchronize. Their evolving connection reflects in the characters' attributes and increasingly aligned choices, blurring the lines between them until they become nearly indistinguishable.
* **Multi-Layered Actions**: Delve into a realm where actions transcend mere choices, evolving into a symphony of complexity. From Elemental Actions (basic maneuvers like movement) to Complex Actions (environmental interactions combined with basic moves) and Natural Actions (commands issued through natural language), gameplay unfolds with strategic depth and dynamic interaction, offering endless possibilities.
* **Self-Evolving Events**: Player's can immerse in narratives that deepen with each passing moment, crafted by the influences of the First and Second Consciousnesses. Each event unfurls with ever-deepening complexity, offering infinite realms for exploration and imagination.
* **Living Relics**: These soul-bound treasures hold stories, emotions, and even their own personalities. For example: • Touch the "Frost Wand," and hear it sing ancient legends in the voice of its first owner. • Approach the "Sword of the Apocalypse" cautiously; failure to understand it may result in its denial of power. • In dire moments, your "Demon Cloak" might sacrifice itself, unleashing untold power to save you.
* **Intelligent NPCs**: NPCs transcend scripted dialogue, each possessing a unique backstory and behavioral parameters. Interactions are dynamic; responses vary based on personality, relationship with the player, and presented choices.
* **Memory Chronicles**: Every quest etches a unique memory, immortalized in bardic songs and remembered through the ages. These tales, carved into history, celebrate heroes' courage and their enduring impact on the world.
* **Trade in Legends**: Players hold the power to buy, sell, and trade these invaluable assets, shaping their destinies with every transaction.
