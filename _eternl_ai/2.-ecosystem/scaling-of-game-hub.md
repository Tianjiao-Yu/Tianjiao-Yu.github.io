# Scaling of Game Hub

Leveraging our infrastructure offerings, Eternal.ai aims to build a Game Hub that houses an extensive collection of games with AI assets and social network ownership. We aim to build a pipeline of 100 games and launch 18 of them within the first 12 months. &#x20;

## **Blue Sea Opportunity**&#x20;

AI is undeniably shaping the [future of gaming](/eternl_ai/1.-overview-and-propositions/future-of-gaming/), but despite the interest, most game developers—boutique studios other than the top brands—[are limited](/eternl_ai/1.-overview-and-propositions/ai-game-developer-challenges/) in AI game production. The reason is that, aside from the majority of unsatisfactory technologies, most solutions are not catered to help boutique developers build AI game experiences, but rather: &#x20;

1. Tailored for top studios and AAA titles such as inworld.ai—easier to profit.
2. Using AI as productivity rather than experience tools such as unity—clearer market fit.
3. Focusing on social chats rather than game interactions such as charisma.ai—broader market size.&#x20;

## **Our Offerings**

Eternl.ai provides highly attractive offerings to these unserved developers:  &#x20;

1. Integrate AI experiences in games at minimal costs. &#x20;
2. Support from top AI scientists and game producers.&#x20;
3. Unique AI+ and Web3 monetization potentials.
4. Be the earliest games in the next AI Steam. &#x20;
5. Non-exclusive publishing requirements. &#x20;

At minimal costs and resources, game developers can transform their games into AI+ and/or blockchain+, unlock diversified monetization channels, and launch their games on our Game Hub and other preferred platforms.&#x20;

## **Scaling Strategy**

### 1. Platform Game Types

In our Game Hub, there are two types of AI games.&#x20;

1. **AI-Enhanced**: Conventional games that incorporate AI functions to elevate player experiences.
2. **AI-Native**: Games that are reimagined from scratch with previously unfeasible AI capabilities.&#x20;

Our platform games are not required to launch their own tokens nor NFTs. They can monetize entirely on the conventional GMV model and launch tokens permissionlessly when they see the value down the road. Our goal is to minimize onboarding friction given that the blockchain experience of cross-game AI assets and social network is already embedded in every platform game, crypto-native or not. &#x20;

### 2. Strategy

In the early stage, our Game Hub scales by AI-enhancing and onboarding high-quality existing Web2 games, published or unpublished previously. This enables us to bootstrap with a large number of AI games within a short period of time.  &#x20;

Among the games available through our Game Hub, we are incubating fully reimagined AI-native blockbusters by top game producers in the game industry. Our in-house AI-native game will be the first Web3 AI-native MMORPG, along with other AI-native games in our pipeline.&#x20;

### **3. Roadmap**

We aim to build a pipeline of 100 games and launch 18 of them within the first 12 months. &#x20;
