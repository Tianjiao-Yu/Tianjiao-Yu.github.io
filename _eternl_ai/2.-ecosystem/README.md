# 2. Ecosystem

Our AGI Gaming Ecosystem consists of three infrastructure components—Gaming AGI, Compute Network, and Gaming AGI Rollup, each of which aims to empower game developers to build, operate, and monetize AI games respectively. The goal is to serve the unmet need of game developers and onboard AI games to [scale our Game Hub](scaling-of-game-hub.md).

## Infrastructure

## 1. Gaming AGI

Our [Gaming AGI](../4.-gaming-agi/) enables developers to create AI game experiences with low technical barriers and costs. Developers adopt our [SDKs](../3.-ability-sdks/) to interact with Our Gaming AGI and build intelligent agents and dynamic worlds for their games. The key highlights of our Gaming AGI are:

* **Game-specific**: Our gaming AGI facilitates seamless integration across diverse game genres, showcasing exceptional versatility to meet a wide array of game design requirements.
* **Easy-to-integrate**: Our gaming AGI aims for accessibility, catering to developers of all skill levels with seamless integration via game plugins. It also comprehends input prompts based on our documented structure, producing consistent quality output.
* **Free-of-charge**: Most features are free to support game developers for AI integration. Basic tools include avatars, NPCs, monsters, and collectibles for the ever evolving game worlds powered by AI.

## 2. Compute Network

Our [Compute Network](../5.-compute-network/) provides reliable and affordable compute resources for AI game inferencing. It optimizes aggregation, distribution, and verification of compute supply provided by decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs), centralized GPU services, miners, and RTX4090-equipped players. The core highlights of our Compute Network are:&#x20;

* **Aggregation:** Inferencing demands from our platform games are distributed to our partners, and we do not plan to profit from computes. The goal is to aggregate massive compute resources for a reliable and competitively priced compute market for AI game developers.  &#x20;
* **Tailored for Web3:** Decentralized inferencing involves concerns about model protection and compute verification, and most GPUs in DePINs can't support large language models. Eternl.ai shares our proprietary obfuscated lightweight model with our node partners. &#x20;
* **Near Zero Gas:** Daily settlement of inferencing costs is made possible by a centralized group of compute purchasers, all of whom are our platform games and recurring buyers. This avoids recurring gas fees for every inferencing transaction booked. &#x20;

## 3. Gamer Rollup

Our [Gamer Rollup](../6.-gamer-rollup/) is the foundational layer that hosts our ecosystem, empowers developers to monetize from global players and web3 communities, as well as enables the unique game experience of AI assets and social network ownership. The key highlights of the rollup include:&#x20;

* **AI Agent NFT:** Enable players to own their AI assets—the identity, personality, and special abilities of AI avatars, collectibles, pets, and more—and use them across games.&#x20;
* **Social Graph:** Enable players to use and flourish their social network across platform games. &#x20;
* **Monetization:** Developers can sell AI assets, such as special dialogue styles, worldviews, and in-game abilities, such as invisible voyaging. &#x20;
