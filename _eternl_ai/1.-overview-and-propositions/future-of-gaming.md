# Future of Gaming

Our core belief is that AI will transform the game experience by expanding the current boundary for game design and that blockchain facilitates cross-game AI assets—the identity, personality, and special abilities of AI avatars, collectibles, pets, and more—and social network ownership.&#x20;

## Extended Game Interaction Boundaries

The traditional game experience is defined by two factors—Players and Environments, and all games are designed based on the dichotomy of Player versus Player (PvP) and Player versus Environment (PvE). Incorporating AI in game design will expand the boundary of gameplay by adding AI as a third factor. Some AI-powered game design examples are:&#x20;

* **AI-enhanced PvE** (Players vs. Environment): Unlike conventional PvE experience with limited action outcomes, AI-enhanced PvE allows gamers to explore endless possibilities based on real-time decisions, creating dynamic and personalize content.
* **PvPvA** (Player vs. Player vs. AI): AI introduces powerful NPCs as a third faction in traditional PvP. Players compete against each other while facing AI-driven threats or interventions.
* **P+A v P+A** (Player+AI. vs Player+AI): A twist on team-based competitions, pairing players with AI entities to form teams that compete against each other.
* **AI World**: An AI-native environment is continuously shaped by the interplay and cumulative effects of all entities within the game, including all players' and AI agents' behaviors.&#x20;

## New Possibilities of Game Design&#x20;

The key to an enjoyable game lies in engaging the player's psychological triggers—the desire for progression, the thrill of overcoming challenges, the joy of exploration, and the excitement of randomness. AI opens up new possibilities for mental stimulation.

For example,&#x20;

* In RPGs with AI, progression is enriched by dynamically generated adventures, encounters, battles, and NPC interactions, unlike those in their traditional counterpart with limited pre-crafted content.&#x20;
* In battling gameplay, AI adversaries adapt tactics intelligently, providing well-matched challenges that enhance strategic depth. Beyond the psychological thrill, AI can also enhance visual dynamism, adding aesthetic pleasure to victories and transforming battles into memorable spectacles that enrich the overall experience.

## Ownership of AI Assets and Social Networks

Blockchain technology enables unprecedented digital ownership and interoperability. Players can transport their identities, AI assets, and social connections across all games, breaking down barriers to form an interconnected AI gaming metaverse. Maintaining persistent digital lives, players develop deep emotional and social attachments that transcend individual game titles.
